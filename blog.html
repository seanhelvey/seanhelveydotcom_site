Our third full episode will be finished sometime this week. While each person featured so far has been very unique and interesting, I hope that we can branch out further over the next year and have slightly more frequent posts. Also, if anyone is aware of a sponsor who would be willing to donate space for less than an hour every couple of weeks for a quiet interview, please let us know!</p>

        <p><p>So, what is the problem? Python is easy enough to read that Guido was able to debug his program in a matter of seconds during his keynote. If it were a large system with several dozen developers though, it would surely be more difficult to write tests and prevent errors from occurring. While Python is strongly typed, it is a <a title="dynamic programming language" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming_language" target="_blank">dynamic programming language</a>, meaning these checks happen at runtime instead of during compilation.</p>

        </h2>

        <p><p>Over the course of the last week I attended both PyCon in Montreal and <a title="LambdaConf" href="http://www.degoesconsulting.com/lambdaconf/" target="_blank">LamdaConf</a> right here in Boulder. I have always enjoyed using Python, but thanks to <a title="one outstanding professor" href="http://www.coryplock.com/" target="_blank">one outstanding professor</a>, I also have very fond memories of functional programming and lambda calculus from grad school. Both conferences were amazing, and there were similarities between the communities, but these are two fundamentally different styles of programming.</p>

        <p><p>My first experience developing software was in a group setting. It became clear to me that the three of us working in the lab were able to get more done than any one of us would have been able to independently. I could chime in when something made sense to me and listen closely if another person had a unique insight into a problem. The <a title="romanticized notion" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odOzMz-fOOw" target="_blank">romanticized notion</a> of a lone wolf hacker had no place there. We were working together as a team.</p>

The tutorials available at <a title="nodejs.org" href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">nodejs.org</a> are extremely thorough and very helpful, but you may run into some of the same issues that I did when expanding from your basic “hello world” application. First we will discuss Node.js specifically and then we will move on to deployment with Heroku.</p>

If you are going to maintain a Partial Financial Hardship (PFH) for the next 20-25 years, then Income Based Repayment (IBR) or Pay As You Earn (PAYE) may be good options for you, but what if you don’t?</p>
