    <blockquote>
  <p>“If you can control the rising of the mind into ripples, you will experience Yoga.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I read Sri Swami Satchidananda’s translation and commentary on The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali and would like to share my brief notes in case it is helpful. For me, The Sutras are extremely interesting because they are ancient and have been highly influential. The translation and notes are very practical and insightful, so hopefully an even more condensed version here captures some of that.</p>

<p>While the original Sutras may seem inaccessible, Satchidananda’s notes quickly point out that almost all of them are written only to elaborate on the first few, summarized in the quote above. I found that to be quite striking, and also very encouraging. Yoga teachers will say things like this, but still most people think that yoga is about poses, instead of controlling the mind.</p>

<p>Another key takeaway for me relates to meditation. Again, meditation guides will tell you to integrate your practice. While you may only meditate for 5-10 minutes in a day, the aim is to incorporate that into your life. The Sutras make this clear, by saying that it is more of a practice than a philosophy, and you need to practice all of the time for a long time.</p>

<p>Please take my notes with a grain of salt. These are my notes based on another persons translations and notes. Notes on notes on notes! The notes here below are not the original Sutras, but a distillation or key takeaway based on the original Sutra of Patanjali and commentary from Satchidananda’s translation.</p>
