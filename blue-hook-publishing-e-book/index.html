    <p>Blue Hook, a boutique web development consultancy headquartered in Boulder, has announced plans to release an e-book in 2016. While the company actively develops mobile-friendly websites and application programming interfaces (APIs) for clients, they are focused on building a consulting practice, and having a bigger impact on highly technical teams.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“Working with managers and entire teams is more fulfilling for us. We are always focused on quality and craftsmanship when we build products for clients, but helping them realign their own focus and refine their process allows teams to do this independently, making their businesses more sustainable.” -Sean Helvey, Founder &amp; Engineer</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The book will contain a series of blog posts which will be freely available over the coming year. The Blue Hook methodology will be broken down into sections on philosophy, strategy, and tactics or techniques. Each of the first 10 questions in the <a href="/the-startup-quality-survey/">Startup Quality Survey</a> will have a dedicated chapter. The strategy segment will be a general overview and techniques will be described individually in a more pragmatic manner.</p>

  <p class="wp-caption-text">
    The philosophy behind the survey will be described in an e-book.
  </p>
</div>

<p>An example of a technique used by Blue Hook is the “developer for a day” method which Helvey pioneered while working as a software developer on various teams. Most consultants have no experience as a software developer, but Helvey has the unique capability of actually working with the team, and assessing the engineering process from their point of view. This helps him to establish rapport, which can open up lines of communication that might be unavailable to non-technical managers.</p>

<p>Publishing an e-book will be a critical first step in building an international brand for Blue Hook, as the posts will be aggregated and translated into other languages. Stay tuned over the next couple of months if you are interested in learning more.</p>
